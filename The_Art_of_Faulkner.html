      <h2>The Art of Faulkner's Narrative Technique</h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In the 1920s, Russian formalist scholars made what would be one of the most
  influential distinctions in the study of narrative: story vs. plot.
  A leading exponent of this view, Viktor Shklovsky posited that authors took
  the basic materials of a story, and shaped them into a plot. In this framing,
  the story or "fabula" is the sequence of events as they occurred, their
  chronological order, while, the plot or "syuzhet" is the order of events
  in which they are conveyed to the reader.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Based on this distinction,
  an elaborate vocabulary for describing narrative structures became available.
  Nearly a century old, the vital distinction between story and plot has not
  remained unchallenged.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> A particularly trenchant criticism is that the
  existence of a "story" implies the existence of an underlying,
  total order outside of the story world. Raising a broader set of questions
  about the feasibility of ever being able to separate a story from the way it is told.</p>
<h3>Creating the Chronologies</h3>
<p>These criticisms notwithstanding, the <em>Digital Yoknapatawpha</em> project,
  has undertaken the task of encoding both the chronological order of an event
  along with its sequence in the text. The process for doing this is not unproblematic.
  For example, in the <em>Sound and the Fury</em> it is easy to order the sequence
  of the chapters because Faulkner gives their dates: "April Seventh, 1928",
  "June Second, 1910", "April Sixth, 1928", and "April Eighth, 1928." Clearly,
  the chronological sequence of chapters is chapter 2, 3, 1, and 4.
  Yet, anyone who has read the <em>Sound and the Fury</em> knows that ordering
  the sequence of events within chapters is part of the challenge of the work,
  and, indeed, also its art.</p>
<p>For this reason, Faulkner's chronologies have become somewhat of a
  bailiwick for scholars, and many have tried to establish the chronology of
  either Yoknapatawpha County in general, or specific stories.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>
  The DY editors have relied on many previous studies to establish the
  chronological order for all of Faulkner's texts. Still, even with the help
  of this robust corpus, sequencing the events of a story is a very involved
  process, and there are many interpretive decisions that the <em>DY</em>
  collaborators had to make in order to establish these chronologies. While it
  makes no sense to enumerate each specific issue, suffice it to say that these
  were broadly related to the use of relative time. In Faulkner, and in most
  other narratives, time is not always specified by date, but can be relational.
  Concepts like "before" "after", "a couple of years ago", and "around the same time"
  all indicate the relative sequence of an event, but do not indicate its
  specific position on a timeline. For example, is the event that happened
  "a couple of years ago" "before" or "after" the event that happened
  "around the same time"? In some cases, deciding the order came down to what
   would be the most logically consistent sequence of events, something which,
   by the way, did not always trouble Faulkner.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup></p>
      <h3>Interpreting the Charts<h3>
              <h4>Linearity</h4>
              <p>In the charts, the time structure of the text has been mapped
                with the story on the y-axis (vertical) and the plot on the x-axis
                (horizontal). From left to right on the x-axis is the sequence of
                events as told in the text by page number, and moving farther
                right means moving farther along in the text. Meanwhile, the
                chronology is ordered from earliest to latest on the y-axis,
                and events that are lower down occur before events that are higher up.
                In a chart where events are conveyed to the reader in the order in which
                they occur, the slope should be around forty-five degrees.
                In the chart below, "Raid", most of the events occur in the
                order they are conveyed to the reader. There are a couple of
                moments where there are "dips". These are moments when the text
                refers to an earlier event. This is commonly known as a flashback or analepsis.
                On the whole though, the chart indicates a relatively linear sequence of events.</p>
                <img src="images/DY_narrative analysis _Raid_ (Rank Order).svg" class="image">
<p>Part of Faulkner's signature writing style are his experiments with time, and these are
  very visible in the charts from his more canonical works. In <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>,
  the chapters are "out of order", but so are many of the events within the chapters.
  The low-high split of points on this chart indicates a constant jump back and forth in time,
  especially the first two hundred pages of the novel. These are roughly the "Benjy" and "Quentin"
  chapters. Viewed from this perspective, it is possible to contrast "Raid" and <em>The
  Sound and the Fury</em> and conclude that the latter is less linear.</p>
  <img src="images/DY_narrative analysis The Sound and the Fury (Rank Order).svg" class="image">

  <h4>Narrative Status</h4>
  <p>Along with the sequence of the event the DY collaborators also created
    a rubric for indicating how that event is conveyed to the reader.
    In some cases, there is a third person narrator, in other cases an event is
    remembered, as when Benjy and Quentin go about their respective days.
    At other times, events are told by characters in a text, something quite
    different yet again. A full overview of the differences can be found <a href="http://faulkner.drupal.shanti.virginia.edu/content/instructions-0">here</a>.
    Narrative status thereby provides another window into understanding how
    Faulkner structures his narratives. In <em>Go Down, Moses</em> events are
    conveyed to the reader through a multiplicity of perspectives, adding to the
    ambiguity of the narrative and the richness of its interpretation. </p>

<h4>Rank Order and Date Order</h4>
<p>The most natural way to think of chronology is date order. It is one of the most common descriptors of someone's life, a born date and death date. The sequence of dates between those rather definite book-ends is somewhat less definitive. People might remember the year or even month of an important life event, but they may not remember the day, or they may remember the day but are hazy on the details of the sequence of events leading up to it. With the help of external sources, these sequences can sometimes be reconstructed. Much the same, the sequencing of historical events too relies on cross-referencing sources to establish a timeline, though such timelines also suffer from lacunae.</p>
<p>These problems are compounded when establishing a timeline for fictional narratives, since there are usually no external sources to reference. There is no way to pull up Quentin's class schedule at Harvard to establish where he should have been on June 2nd and at what time! As such, the DY collaborators have inferred dates based on the sequence of events. Needless to say, it is not always possible to pin down one singular date for an event, and this is why an "earliest possible start date" and "latest possible end date" for an event were entered. Hence, an event that takes place during a year is given a range of year, unless any more information about the possible date is known. Ideally, all date ranges would be as narrow as possible, in reality this is not the case.</p>
<p>As date ranges are necessarily ambiguous, the rank order of events is also available for selection. The rank order sequences events as represented in the chronology, but does not take into consideration the narrative distance between them. In The Sound and the Fury the earliest event is the birth of Jesus, an event that happens some time before the narrative present of the text. On the rank order chart this is a small green dot on the x-axis, right around page 300. On the date order chart this event is more apparent:</p>
<img src="images/DY_narrative analysis The Sound and the Fury (Date Order).svg" class="image">
<p>By default, charts are graphed by rank order, though undoubtedly the date order graphs offer equally interesting insights. In particular, they tend to highlight how the historical past is in tension with the narrative present. In some cases, the date range of a chart is very narrow, such as in "The Hound" where the narrative sequence is almost entirely in the narrative present, with one event in the past whose possible date range is less clear.</p>
<img src="images/DY_narrative analysis _The Hound_ (Date Order).svg" class="image">
<p>In other cases, the narrative jumps around in time in leaps and bounds, suggesting a positioning withing a larger historical time scale. For instance, The Reivers is told from the perspective of the 1960s and stretches as far back as the American Revolution, but is mostly situated at the turn of the 20th century.</p>
<img src="images/DY_narrative analysis The Reivers (Date Order).svg" class="image">
<p>The chart very nicely underscores the subtitle of the novel, A Reminiscence, and demonstrates that the novel is as much about the events that transpire in the novel, as those events are viewed from a post-World War II perspective within a larger view of American history.</p>
<h3>Utilizing the Charts</h3>
<p>The graphing library used to create these charts, <a href="https://plot.ly/javascript/">Plotly.js</a>, has some built in functionality that lets users play around with the charts. For example, clicking the small picture icon will download the image. It is also possible to zoom in to take a closer look at a sequence. This is particularly useful when studying a novel. Hovering over the data points will reveal the specific page number and sequence within the page when that event is taking place, along with the first 8-10 words of the event. The legend is clickable as well, and certain data elements (called traces) can be removed shown and hidden to investigate a specific aspect of the text.</p>
